Project Title: Fingerprint Recognition

Authors: Vibhav Hosahalli Venkataramaiah, Vignesh SP

Description:

Fingerprints are considered to be the best and fastest method for biometric identification. They are secure to use, unique for every person and do not change in oneâ€™s lifetime. Human fingerprints are rich in details called minutiae, which can be used as identification marks for security purposes. The approach mainly involves extraction of minutiae points from sample fingerprint images and then performing matching based on the number of minutiae pairing among two fingerprints in question.

Contents :

Codes - This folder consists of the multiple codes used throughout the flow of fingerprint feature extraction and feature matching. 

System Requirements:

Any system that supports MATLAB R2014 and above
Scanner for generating fingerprint image data

Usage :

In order to test the given code, run the "main" script, this selects the 2 images to be compared, runs the required functions to get the minutiae points and performs feature comparison.
